# dot-files

This repo contains the dot files for my Mac workflow: fish, iTerm2, and others

## Usage
Run setup.sh, then add the iterm2 profile. Restart everything and you should be good to go. 

I made sure to backup important files in case you want to keep them but make sure to backup your dotfiles anyway.

## Setup.sh
This will install:
* firacode
* homebrew
* fish + OMF + bobthefish
* VS Code extensions + tweaked config + cli support

## Font
I use Firacode-retina with ligatures enabled

## iTerm
The custom profile uses the `Brogrammer` theme with some helpful tweaks enabled

## Fish
The setup script will install OMF and bobthefish theme. I also have some alias shortcuts to use various tools faster, like `kc` instead of `kubectl`

## VS Code
The config has tweaks for things like Terraform and other plugins. The setup script will install a bunch of extensions.
